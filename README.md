# cppin21days
This is the repository that will hold the chapters for 21 days of learning.

Organization of the rpository:
    We store the code for each day in a separate folder like 
    day1
    day2 ... so far to day 21. 
    Each day is independent from the others. e.g. it is self containing
    We will use the repository as a communication tool writing comments and amendments trough our code. 
    It is a great way to learn to collaborate with each other.
